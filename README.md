# Crime_Analysis

ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project analyzes crime data to predict whether a specific area will experience high or low crime in a given month. The analysis involves grouping crime data by month and area, performing feature engineering, and applying machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression with and without regularization, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes to classify crime levels. This repository includes code, insights, and model evaluations that can aid policymakers and law enforcement in making informed decisions.
