# Crime_Analysis

📋 Overview

This project analyzes crime data to predict whether a specific area will experience high or low crime in a given month. The analysis involves grouping crime data by month and area, performing feature engineering, and applying machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression with and without regularization, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes to classify crime levels. This repository includes code, insights, and model evaluations that can aid policymakers and law enforcement in making informed decisions and improve public safety.

🔍 Problem Statement

Objective: To predict whether an area will experience high or low crime in a given month based on historical data.  
This prediction enables law enforcement agencies to proactively plan and allocate resources effectively.
